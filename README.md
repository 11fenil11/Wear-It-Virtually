1)	Introduction

1.1  About Domain/Area :-

	Now a days software can be used to complete some task virtually.Software makes our tasks simpler by doing them virtually so that it becomes time efficient. 

1.2 About the Definition :-
	
	‘Wear It virtually’ is a project by which any person can virtually wear and change clothes by using the software application . This could be time saving for customer and shopkeeper as well. 

1.3  Users :-

    	Customer
    	Employee
    	Developer
    	Owner

1.4  Modules and Functionalities :-
1)	Customer:-

       •	Register
       •	Login
       •	Virtually change clothes
       •	See previous history
       •	Send feedback

2)	Employee:-

        •	Software Update
        •	Add staff
        •	Team management

3)Developer:-
 
      •	Software Maintenance
      •	Software Update
     
 4)Owner:-
      
      •	View Feedback
      •	Approve/Reject complaints

2)	 Literature Review

2.1 Observation on Domain
		Using software for virtual purpose is time saving and efficient . For instance, our team visited a cloth shop on 11 august, 2019. We found that the trial rooms at mall were inconvenient for disabled person . There was also too much rush for trials . So we conclude that, it would be time saving and convenient for user if he / she can change clothes virtually at home itself . This can save much time for any user as he / she doesn’t need to go to shop physically and there to buy clothes . The software also reduces the work for shop-keeper..
	
2.2 Literature Review related to your definition
		Virtual try-on of clothes has received much attention recently due to its commercial potential. It can be used for online shopping or intelligent recommendation to narrow down the selections to a few designs and sizes. In this, we present a mixed reality system for 3D virtual clothes try-on that enables a user to see himself/herself wearing virtual clothes while looking at a mirror display, without taking off his/her actual clothes. The user can select various virtual clothes for trying-on. The system physically simulates the selected virtual clothes on the user's body in real-time and the user can see virtual clothes fitting on his/ her own 3D model from various angles as he / she moves.



 

3)	 Design Consideration to detail design part

3.1 Function Requirement
This section provides the requirement overview of the product.

3.1.1	Home Page:-
                 Home page is main page of software. When user will visit the system, this page will be shown first.

3.1.2	Registration Form:-
                 Registration form will be used to create new user account. This page has following elements:
	User name Text Box, user will enter the name here.
	Password Text Box , encrypted password will be entered here.
1.	Re-type PasswordText Box , encrypted password checking box.
	Email idText Box, User will enter email here.
	Register Register Button

3.1.3	Login Form:-
         In Login Form separate login will be create for user.
	User nameText box for user name
	PasswordText box encrypted
	Submit Login button

3.1.4	Clothes Selection:-
User can select different clothes with different design and sizes . He / She wear them virtually . If he / she finds his/her size unavailable in the size table then he/she can report and then the size will be added to the size chart in software.
 3.1.5  Send Feedback:-
	       User can send feedback when their complaint has been solved.





3.2 Non Functional Attributes 
3.2.1  Availability:-
	The software is available at all time as it is online.
3.2.2	Security:-
	Only authorized users can access the system with username and password.
3.2.3  Performance :-
	Software is efficient and easily updatable
3.2.4 User Friendly :-
	The System is very interactive.
3.2.5 Maintainability :-
	Backups for database are available.


3.3	Design for cost/ Environment 	

In ‘Wear It Virtually’ customer can directly try different clothes with different sizes and can buy the cloth which best fits . So it is not required for the customer to go to different shops . This software application saves the time . It is more efficient also . Sometimes it is possible that customer tries so many clothes and don’t like any . This could waste the time of shopkeeper also . So by using this software shopkeeper directly comes to know that which item customer wants . So this software is cost-effective.


3.4	Tools & Technology
	Pycharm
	Tensor Flow
	Anaconda
	Jupyter Notebook
	Keras for neural networks
	Python(OpenCV3, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit )

   6)	Conclusion & Future Work		

6.1.1 Conclusion: -
	We are creating 3D model using user’s uploaded video  and by this user can use this model to embed different outfits on his own model so that he can get an idea how it looks.  
6.1.2 Future Enhancement:-
	Our project can be widely used in online shopping domains used for clothing such as Amazon, Flipkart etc. So we are planning to sell them our API or create our own website.
